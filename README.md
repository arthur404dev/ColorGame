**Instructions:**

The Game itself is pretty self explanatory. 

Each time you reload the game it'll generate random colors (depending on the difficulty) and following to the rule:

| R | G | B |
|---|---|---|
|Red|Green|Blue|

That's the numbers you're going to see right next to the header. And you should guess which color is the selected by clicking the circles.

Remember that all the numbers can go from 0 to 255, 0 being the total absence of that said color, and 255 being the full presence of that color
